# 🎹 WafelNativeSynths

**WafelNativeSynths** is my personal project to learn how to integrate **C++** with **Android** using the **NDK**, **CMake**, and **OpenSL ES**.  
It demonstrates how to build a simple, real-time software synthesizer engine in C++, and control it from Kotlin via **JNI** and **Platform Channels**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Learn to write and build native C++ code with the Android NDK
- Use OpenSL ES for low-latency audio synthesis
- Understand JNI and how native functions are accessed from Kotlin
- Explore real-time signal generation: sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth waves
- Apply volume normalization and continuous playback buffering

---

## 📁 Tech Stack

- **C++** – For real-time audio engine
- **OpenSL ES** – Android’s low-level audio API
- **Android NDK + CMake** – Native build system
- **Kotlin/Java** – Android UI layer
- **JNI** – Bridge between native C++ and Kotlin/Java

Feel free to clone this repo and experiment with the audio engine if you're curious about how native audio programming works on Android!
